            <h3> What is Two Million Pixels? </h3>
            <p> A digital canvas filled with 2 Million Pixels, and filled by the crypto-community.
                Inspired by the world’s popular project (The Million Dollar Homepage).
                
                Users can easily purchase the pixels using cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, USDT, IDEA).
                Then Users are advised to upload the image depending on how many pixels they have purchased.
                So their uploaded image will be added to the canvas of 2M pixels.
                
                Once all the 2M Pixels are sold and the canvas is filled with the users artwork/image then it is uploaded as
                an world’s biggest NFT on the Opensea platform.
            
                Making a record-breaking NFT. To be the world's biggest Worldwide NFT. </p>

            <p> The challenge was to design a digital canvas that contains 2 Million Pixels, and let the users

                Let the users buy the pixels and let them upload their image/artwork depending on the pixels they have 
                bought, and place it on the digital canvas.
